This project is a project I did to practice/learn python. It uses OCR to read the creel reports downloaded from this link 
(https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/north/trtycrlsrvys.html) into drive and then analyze them. I only did it for the lakes of northern WI 
as my dad lives there and loves to fish.
